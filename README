    - or perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/install/wherever/you/want LIB=/your/preferred/lib/directory
   make

If that is all too much trouble or you just want to test this module,
place it in the same directory as your perl script and add to the
first line of that script "-I.", without the quotes. This will add
the current path to your library path.
